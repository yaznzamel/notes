# Memory Monitoring



## 💾 Memory
- `free -h` – memory usage
- `vmstat 1` – memory, processes, system performance
- `cat /proc/meminfo` – detailed memory stats


## 🔥 CPU
- `top` – real-time process viewer
- `htop` – prettier, interactive version of `top`
- `mpstat -P ALL` – CPU usage per core



## ⚙️ Processes
- `ps aux` – list all processes
- `top` – includes CPU/memory usage
- `pstree` – tree of running processes
- `pgrep <name>` – find PID by name
